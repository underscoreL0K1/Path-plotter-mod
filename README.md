Formerly Private

A mod I made at the request of Scout_Tiger for the Spawn Plotter Project

You can convert the txt output file to a file that plas.io can use to render it. 

Kills your player after every 5 minutes (or smt, I forget). Requires baritone

%ToggleTracer is the activation command
Don't use auto respawn, there's one built in
